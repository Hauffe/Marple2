Minority groups with dietary restrictions, allergies, intolerances, and lifestyles, find it difficult to identify products appropriate to their routine. Even though norms impose a responsibility on industries to warn of unwanted and sometimes harmful ingredients to health on their products, it is still difficult to identify certain codes and terms created for the food and cosmetics industry, and not for the consuming public. With this scenario, this article aims to detail the development of a digital solution with the purpose of helping to identify ingredients that do not suit food and lifestyle restrictions in products.
